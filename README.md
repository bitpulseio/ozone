# üåç Bitpulse Ozone Layer ‚Äî MVP (Sepolia Testnet)

**A simplified, composable risk layer for DeFi.**  
Bitpulse Ozone connects users to leading DeFi protocols like AAVE and Uniswap through minimal ERC-4626 vaults, continuously monitored off-chain by Bitpulse‚Äôs risk engine.

---

## Overview

The Bitpulse Ozone Layer provides a **risk-underwritten gateway** to decentralized trading and lending pools.  
Each supported protocol (AAVE, Uniswap, Curve, etc.) is wrapped in a lightweight **Vault Interface (AVI)** ‚Äî a minimal ERC-4626 contract that forwards deposits and withdrawals directly to the underlying protocol.

All aggregation, analytics, and risk evaluation occur **off-chain** in Bitpulse‚Äôs backend services, powering a unified portfolio dashboard and real-time monitoring.

### Core Design Principles
- **Minimal On-Chain Logic** ‚Äì single-purpose, auditable contracts per protocol.  
- **Always-Open Withdrawals** ‚Äì no custody; users always control their funds.  
- **Off-Chain Intelligence** ‚Äì analytics, risk scoring, and alerts handled in backend.  
- **Composability** ‚Äì ERC-4626 standard for seamless DeFi integrations.

## System Architecture

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **User Wallet (EOA)** | Interacts via (https://testnet.bitpulse.io) |
| **Vault Contracts (AVI / ERC-4626)** | Lightweight pass-through wrappers for each DeFi protocol |
| **Target Protocols** | AAVE v3, Uniswap v2, Curve |
| **Admin Multisig (2-of-3)** | Controls upgrades, caps, and circuit breaker |
| **Subgraph / Indexer** | Reads and indexes vault events for analytics and UI |
| **Aggregator & Risk Engine** | Off-chain analytics: APY, TVL, liquidity, risk grades |
| **Alerts Service** | Sends notifications via Email, Telegram, or Webhooks |

## Sepolia Testnet Deployments

| Contract | Address | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **AVIVault ‚Äî bpLINK** | [`0xC730c9C1089D39f0A95FCE6B6508317b9fb4c4Db`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xC730c9C1089D39f0A95FCE6B6508317b9fb4c4Db) | AAVE v3 vault for LINK |
| **AVIVault ‚Äî bpWBTC** | [`0x183edACd4eD97695f8800D8149abA60119FBB7BD`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x183edACd4eD97695f8800D8149abA60119FBB7BD) | AAVE v3 vault for WBTC |
| **AVIVault ‚Äî bpETH** | [`0x6a02D5C10E8204bc0ceA01Bc1B9A1359175cC7Ae`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x6a02D5C10E8204bc0ceA01Bc1B9A1359175cC7Ae) | AAVE v3 vault for ETH |
| **Bitpulse Safe (Multisig)** | [`0x11DBA0E94E62e48471E119d9c1ceC5dF7800970e`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x11DBA0E94E62e48471E119d9c1ceC5dF7800970e) | Fee collection and admin control |

Each vault mints **Bitpulse claim tokens** (e.g., `bpLINK`, `bpWBTC`, `bpETH`) representing ownership of the assets supplied into AAVE.

## Contract Features

### Vault Flow
1. **Deposit** ‚Üí User deposits assets ‚Üí supplied to AAVE ‚Üí vault mints ERC-4626 shares.  
2. **Accrual** ‚Üí Vault `totalAssets()` grows automatically as AAVE interest accrues.  
3. **Redeem** ‚Üí User redeems shares ‚Üí vault withdraws from AAVE ‚Üí returns tokens.

### Admin Controls
- `setCap()` ‚Äî maximum TVL limit per vault  
- `setDepositsDisabled()` ‚Äî disable deposits (withdrawals always available)  
- **Upgradeable Proxy** ‚Äî UUPS with 48-hour timelock, 2-of-3 multisig

### Security
- Reentrancy guard  
- Hard/soft TVL caps  
- No custody risk  
- Withdraw path always on-chain  
- Audit-ready minimal footprint

---

## Off-Chain Intelligence

Bitpulse services monitor all vaults via an indexed subgraph, computing:
- Real-time TVL, APY, and utilization  
- Liquidity risk and reserve health  
- A‚ÄìD risk grades  
- Alerts when markets pause, caps are reached, or volatility spikes  

**Notifications** are sent via Email, Telegram, or Webhooks.  
Access to premium analytics requires holding the `$BP` token (coming soon).

---

## Getting Started (Testnet)

1. Connect wallet to **Sepolia** on (https://testnet.bitpulse.io)  
2. Select any active AAVE vault (e.g., bpLINK, bpWBTC)  
3. Deposit test tokens ‚Üí receive `bp` claim tokens  
4. Watch your balance grow with AAVE yield  
5. Withdraw anytime ‚Äî fully non-custodial  

---

## Roadmap

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **MVP (Now)** | AAVE vaults live on Sepolia |
| **Phase 2** | Subgraph monitoring + ERC-1155 multi-vault claims, incentives, Base/Arbitrum support |
| **Phase 3** | `$PULSE` governance + fee routing and risk staking |
